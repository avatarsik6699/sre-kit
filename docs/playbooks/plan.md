# plan — Canonical Playbook

Create or refresh `docs/SPEC.md` from a brief (chat text or a draft file), then scaffold exactly
one `docs/changes/NN-slug.md` from `docs/CHANGE_TEMPLATE.md` with a Backlog derived from the spec,
and switch to its feature branch.

This document is the single source of truth for the `plan` workflow.

In an integrated project, runtime wrappers under `.claude/skills/plan/SKILL.md` (Claude Code),
`.agents/skills/plan/SKILL.md` (generic agent), and `plugins/sdd-workflow/{commands,skills}/plan/...`
(Codex) point here. The wrappers are thin stubs — every workflow detail lives in this file.

## Input

- Optional free-form product brief (one paragraph to several pages).
- Optional file path (e.g. `/plan docs/DRAFT_SPEC.md`) — read the file as the primary source brief
  instead of asking for one in chat.
- Optional mode flag: `--new` (rewrite `docs/SPEC.md` end-to-end) or `--continue` (extend/refine
  the existing spec). If omitted: default to `new` when `docs/SPEC.md` is still mostly template
  placeholders, otherwise `continue`.

## Required reads

- `docs/SPEC.md`
- `docs/STACK.md`
- `docs/KNOWN_GOTCHAS.md` (if present)
- `docs/changes/` and `docs/changes/archive/` (existing change files, to pick the next `NN` and
  confirm nothing with the same slug already exists)
- The file at the given path, if one was passed as input

## Procedure

### 1. Determine the brief source and mode

- If a file path is given, read it in full and treat it as the source brief. Do not ask the
  architect to repeat it in chat.
- Otherwise use the chat-provided brief, or ask for one if none was given.
- Parse `--new` / `--continue`; if both given, stop and ask for exactly one. Resolve the default
  per the Input section otherwise. Record the chosen mode in the final report.
- Preserve explicit user wording for domain constraints and business rules — do not silently
  reinterpret strict requirements.

### 2. Build or refresh `docs/SPEC.md`

Only run this step if `docs/SPEC.md` doesn't exist yet, or the brief signals a spec-level change
(new domain area, changed contract, changed NFRs). A brief that only describes the next unit of
work against an already-adequate spec skips straight to step 4.

- In `new` mode: rewrite the full document end-to-end.
- In `continue` mode: keep unaffected sections stable; modify only sections touched by the brief.

Target coverage (see `docs/SPEC.md`'s own section numbering):
1. Project Overview and Goals
2. Domain Context
3. Data Model
4. API/Backend Contract
5. Frontend/Client Contract (see step 3 for §5.3 Design System)
6. Auth & Access Model
7. Infrastructure and Deploy/CI
8. Non-Functional Requirements — start from the pre-seeded web checklist in the template
   (security headers/CORS, a11y target, Core Web Vitals budget, observability, backup/restore);
   don't leave a row blank, mark it `n/a` with a one-line reason if it doesn't apply
9. Roadmap (high-level milestones only — no task-level detail; that lives in change files)
10. Out of Scope
11. Open Questions

Rules:
- Replace placeholders and `[TODO]` markers with concrete content whenever the brief allows.
- Keep uncertain items explicit with `[NEEDS_CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers.
- Do not invent external constraints (compliance, SLOs, integrations) unless stated or inferred
  with high confidence from the brief.

### 3. Design flow (§5.3 Design System)

Skip this step in `continue` mode unless the brief explicitly introduces new screens or design
change requests — those default to becoming Backlog items in step 5 instead of reopening this
flow.

- If the brief/attachments include screenshots or explicit design references: for each one, note
  the screen name, route, key components, layout, and interactions; use them to fill §5.1
  (Pages) / §5.2 (Components) concretely and list them under §5.3 Design References.
- If there are none: do not leave §5.3 as a placeholder.
  1. Analyze the domain, audience, and tone implied by the spec.
  2. Invoke the `impeccable` skill to propose 1–2 concrete directions (typography, palette,
     layout patterns, tone) grounded in that analysis — no heavyweight design tooling (no Figma
     plugins, no Pencil-style installs), reasoning and lightweight references only.
  3. Ask a short set of preference questions (max 5): visual tone, light/dark default, density,
     any hard constraints (existing brand colors, accessibility requirements).
  4. Record the chosen direction in §5.3 as the project's Design System baseline.
- Later design change requests (component tweaks, palette adjustments) are ordinary Backlog items
  added via `/work`, not a re-run of this flow — this only runs once per spec/design baseline.

### 4. Run critical validation checks (spec-level, when step 2 ran)

1. **Completeness** — every required section has actionable, implementation-relevant content.
2. **Testability** — requirements are measurable (avoid vague terms like "fast"/"secure" without
   criteria).
3. **Consistency** — no conflicts between sections (auth model vs endpoint access, roadmap vs
   architecture).
4. **Contract readiness** — enough detail to derive a change file's Backlog (data model, endpoints,
   frontend modules, env vars).
5. **Risk coverage** — security/privacy, failure modes, operational constraints addressed.
6. **Roadmap viability** — milestones are incremental and buildable.

For each failed check, add a concrete issue to a temporary gap list, then ask focused clarification
questions (max 5 per round, grouped by theme), update `docs/SPEC.md`, and re-validate. Repeat until
no critical gaps remain, or the architect defers with an explicit `[NEEDS_CLARIFICATION: ...]`
marker.

### 5. Scaffold `docs/changes/NN-slug.md`

- Pick the next `NN` (two digits) by scanning `docs/changes/` and `docs/changes/archive/` for the
  highest existing number and incrementing.
- Derive a short kebab-case `slug` from the unit of work's title.
- Copy `docs/CHANGE_TEMPLATE.md` to `docs/changes/NN-slug.md` and fill it from the brief/spec:
  - **Backlog**: group items into Backend/Frontend/Infra/Data/Other, assign IDs sequentially per
    group (`B1`, `F1`, `I1`, `D1`, `T1`…), detect dependency ordering (migrations before models,
    models before routes, routes before tests), and format each as
    `- [ ] B2 [description] — _Depends on:_ B1` (or `—` if none). IDs are stable once assigned —
    never renumber; a removed item becomes `~~BN~~ (removed)`, never deleted outright.
  - **Files**: explicit create/modify list grouped as backend, frontend, infrastructure, plus any
    "do NOT touch" paths.
  - **Contracts**: a one-line pointer — "see `docs/SPEC.md` §3–§4 and the Files list above" — do
    not hand-copy schema/endpoint/type details into the change file.
  - Leave Architect Review Notes at its default (`No architect review issues recorded`) and
    Implementation Notes empty.
  - Fill the Commit Message placeholder: `feat(change-[NN]): [title] — [2–4 key deliverables]`,
    under 72 chars.

If a subsection yields nothing, write `None` — never leave it blank or a generic TODO.

### 6. Git-flow: create the feature branch

- If not already on `feature/NN-slug`: create it from `main` and switch to it.
- If `main` has uncommitted changes that would be carried onto the new branch, warn and confirm
  before switching.

### 7. Report

```
## plan complete

SPEC.md: updated / unchanged — [reason]
Mode: [new | continue | auto->new | auto->continue]
Source brief: [chat / file: <path>]
Design: filled from references / self-driven via impeccable skill / unchanged
Validation: PASS / PASS with deferred clarifications

Created: docs/changes/NN-slug.md
Branch: feature/NN-slug (created / switched to)

Backlog assigned:
- Backend:  [B1, B2, … or "none"]
- Frontend: [F1, F2, … or "none"]
- Infra:    [I1, … or "none"]
- Data:     [D1, … or "none"]
- Other:    [T1, … or "none"]

Deferred clarifications:
- [list or "none"]

Next: run /work [NN] (or /work [NN] [ID]) to implement Backlog items.
```

## Rules

- Never write to `docs/changes/archive/` from this workflow.
- Extract contracts by reference, not by hand-copying schema/endpoint text into the change file.
- Do not commit.
- Do not run the gate.

## Done when

- `docs/SPEC.md` is concrete, internally consistent, and buildable (or unchanged if this run
  didn't need to touch it).
- Exactly one new `docs/changes/NN-slug.md` exists with a Backlog assigned stable IDs.
- The feature branch for that change exists and is checked out.
